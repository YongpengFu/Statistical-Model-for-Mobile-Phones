# Chapter 1: Introduction

Mobile phones are everywhere, so are the prices. Despite still having the word "phone" in the name, a typical modern smartphone has much more features than just to make and receive calls. They are boasting a staggering range of features, like brand, memory, storage, camera, resolution, just to name a few. And as you can imagine, with all this new technology and features jam packed in one little device costs money, costs a lot of money. A [2020 review](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-8548235/High-end-mobile-phones-price-soared-490-20-years.html) of premium mobile phones shows a staggering _490%_ rise in the last two decades.

With so many mobile phones on the market, it can be difficult to decide which one you want to buy. As a customer, we are particularly interested in finding some relation between all these features and its selling price. To this purpose, we collected the [MobilePhone's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshuy17/mobilephone) from Kaggle and apply a set of statistical analysis hoping to answer some guiding questions:

1. Can we estimate the true average price for mobile phones?
2. What is the impact of each mobile phone's feature on the selling price?
3. Can a classification model to distinguish the selling price range?
3. Can we build a decent model to predict the selling price for a mobile phone?


# Chapter 2: Dataset and Scope of Analysis.

~~We chose a dataset weighting by *simplicity*. That is, we would like to maximize the learning experience applying class content to a toy/stylized modelthat may or may not have any practical use.~~

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 8 columns and 28,036 rows and no missing values. These 8 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **RAM size**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **ROM size**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone. - **Independent Variable**

The data was loaded into RStudio using the "read.csv" function. The data we needed for our analysis include the dependent variable "Price" (in Indian Rupee) and a list of independent variables listed above. The first few records of the dataset is as follows:

```{r 2.1 Load Data}
mobile_dataset <- read.csv("./Updated_Mobile_Dataset.csv")
mobile_dataset %>% head(4)
```
As the first step of investigation, we did the following work to clean up the dataset.

1. Remove any duplicates in the dataset;
2. Because **Model** column contains sub-class of a mobile phone, we decide to further break it down to _Model_ and _Color_;
3. Add additional column to segment the **Price** into 4 different levels.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('./Updated_Mobile_Dataset.csv')

def map_to_cat(price):
    if price < 7500:
        return 'Low'
    elif 7500 <= price < 15000:
        return 'Medium'
    elif 15000 <= price < 30000:
        return 'High'
    elif price >= 30000:
        return 'Very high'

aug_model = data['Model'].copy()
aug_color = [None]*len(aug_model)
aug_price_category = [None]*len(aug_model)
for i,r in data.iterrows():
    aug_model[i] = str(aug_model[i]).replace(r['Company'], '').strip()
    aug_price_category[i] = map_to_cat(r['Price'])
    if (r['Model'].find(',') != -1) and (r['Model'].find('(') != -1):
        aug_color[i] = aug_model[i].split('(')[1].split(',')[0]
        aug_model[i] = aug_model[i].split('(')[0]

data['aug_model'] = aug_model
data['aug_color'] = aug_color
data['aug_price'] = aug_price_category

data = data.drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True)
data = data[data['Company'] != 'Nothing']
data['Company'] = data['Company'].str.capitalize()

data.to_csv('./augmented_dataset.csv', index=False)
data
```
```{r CleanData}
mobile_dataset <- read.csv("./Updated_Mobile_Dataset.csv")
cat("Break down Model column into Model only and Color columns:\n")
#Step 1: remove the Company name from Model
Model_no_Company <- stringr::str_remove(mobile_dataset$Model,mobile_dataset$Company) %>% trimws(., which = c("both"))
#Step 2: remove anything after parentheses to get Model only info
mobile_dataset$Model_Only <- stringr::str_replace(Model_no_Company, " \\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "")
#Step 3: Get the color information from inside the last ()
#Step 3.1: Get the parenthesis and what is inside from the last ()
Model_no_Company_parenthesis <- stringr::str_extract(Model_no_Company, "(?<=\\()([^()]*?)(?=\\)[^()]*$)")
#step 3.2: Get the color by just retaining the info before ,
mobile_dataset$Color <- gsub(",.*$", "", Model_no_Company_parenthesis)
#Step 4: Remove duplicated rows in the dataset
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!duplicated(mobile_dataset),]
#Step 5: cut the price based on the percentile into 4 different levels
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% mutate(Price_Level = ntile(Price, n = 4))
#Step 5.1: map each number level to the character
from <- c(1,2,3,4)
to <- c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")
mobile_dataset$Price_Level <- mapvalues(mobile_dataset$Price_Level, from = from, to = to)
```


After cleaning and breaking down columns, the dataset now consists of 11 columns and 740 rows and no missing values. These 11 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **RAM size**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **ROM size**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **aug_model**: categorical variable. It only contains the Model information for a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **aug_color**: categorical variable. The color of a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **aug_price**: categorical variable. The price level of a mobile phone, with levels of "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High" - **Independent Variable**

The data was again loaded into RStudio using the "read.csv" function. The first few records of the dataset is as follows:

```{r 2.2 Load Data}
mobile_dataset <- as_tibble(mobile_dataset)
cat("The dimension of the dataset:\n")
dim(mobile_dataset)
mobile_dataset %>% head(4)
```






## Scope of Analysis

TODO: Hash out modelling. I recommend a diagram using a tool like lucidcharts.com. 
See the templates section. For instance (see Figure 1 below).
