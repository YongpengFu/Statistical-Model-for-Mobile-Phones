# Dataset

We chose a dataset weighting by *simplicity*. That is, we would like to maximize
the learning experience applying class content to a toy/stylized model 
that may or may not have any practical use.

## Columns

The dataset consists of 8 columns and 28'036 rows and no missing values.

* *Model*: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column.
* *Company*: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer.
* *Price*: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees.
* *Rating*: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees.
* *Number of ratings*: discrete variable: a simple count.
* *Total reviews*: discrete variable: a simple count.
* *RAM size*: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone.
* *ROM size*: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone.

# Scope

TODO: Hash out modelling. I recommend a diagram using a tool like lucidcharts.com. 
See the templates section. For instance (see Figure 1 below).
