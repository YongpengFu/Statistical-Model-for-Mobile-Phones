# Introduction

Mobile phones are everywhere, so are the prices. Despite still having the word "phone" in the name, a typical modern smartphone has much more features than just to make and receive calls. They are boasting a staggering range of applications like brand, memory, storage, camera, resolution, just to name a few. All these cutting edge technology and features packed in one little device does not come without a cost. A [2020 review](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-8548235/High-end-mobile-phones-price-soared-490-20-years.html) of premium mobile phones shows a staggering _490%_ rise in the last two decades.

With so many mobile phones on the market, it can be difficult to decide which one you want to buy. As a customer, we are particularly interested in finding some relation between all these features and its selling price. To this purpose, we collected the [MobilePhone's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshuy17/mobilephone) from Kaggle and apply a set of statistical analysis hoping to answer some guiding questions:

1. Can we estimate the average price for mobile phones?
2. What is the impact of each mobile phone's feature on the selling price?
3. Can a classification model to distinguish the selling price range?
3. Can we build a decent model to predict the selling price for a mobile phone?


# Dataset and Cleanup

The initial dataset consists of 8 columns and 28,036 rows and no missing values. These 8 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **RAM size**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **ROM size**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone. - **Independent Variable**

Some initial steps can be completed to clean the dataset and create new variables which can be used in our analysis. The initial steps for cleaning the dataset are as follows:

1. Remove any duplicates in the dataset;
2. Because **Model** column contains sub-class of a mobile phone, we decide to further break it down to _Model_ and _Color_;
3. Convert all units from **RAM size** and **ROM size** measure to GB and then remove unit suffix;
4. Add additional column to segment the **Price** into 4 different levels;
5. Add additional column to determine if a phone has %G feature or not based on **Model** information.

```{r Cleanup}
mobile_dataset <- read.csv("./Updated_Mobile_Dataset.csv")
#Step 0: convert Model and Company letter to uppercase.
mobile_dataset$Model <- toupper(mobile_dataset$Model)
mobile_dataset$Company <- toupper(mobile_dataset$Company)
#Break down Model column into Model only and Color columns
#Step 1: remove the Company name from Model
Model_no_Company <- stringr::str_remove(mobile_dataset$Model,mobile_dataset$Company) %>% trimws(., which = c("both"))
#Step 2: remove anything after parentheses to get Model only info
mobile_dataset$Model_Only <- stringr::str_replace(Model_no_Company, " \\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "")
#Step 3: Get the color information from inside the last ()
#Step 3.1: Get the parenthesis and what is inside from the last ()
Model_no_Company_parenthesis <- stringr::str_extract(Model_no_Company, "(?<=\\()([^()]*?)(?=\\)[^()]*$)")
#step 3.2: Get the color by just retaining the info before ,
mobile_dataset$Color <- gsub(",.*$", "", Model_no_Company_parenthesis)
#Step 4: Remove duplicated rows in the dataset
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!duplicated(mobile_dataset),]
#Step 5: cut the price based on the percentile into 4 different levels
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% mutate(Price_Level = ntile(Price, n = 4))
#Step 5.1: map each number level to the character
from <- c(1,2,3,4)
to <- c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")
mobile_dataset$Price_Level <- mapvalues(mobile_dataset$Price_Level, from = from, to = to)


#Step 6: Get the numeric part of RomSize (remove GB and MB, but convert MB to GB), discard any record that no numeric in RomSize
#Step 6.1: there are some data input errors for RamSize and RomSize. In the records where RomSize is "Not Known" are swapped with RamSize, so we need to correct that.
RamSize_temp <- ifelse(mobile_dataset$RomSize == "Not Known", "0 GB", mobile_dataset$RamSize)
mobile_dataset$RomSize <- ifelse(mobile_dataset$RomSize == "Not Known", mobile_dataset$RamSize, mobile_dataset$RomSize)
mobile_dataset$RamSize <- RamSize_temp
#Step 6.2: split RomSize into two columns with size number and unit, and convert MB to 1/1000GB, KB to 1/1000000GB
mobile_dataset$RamSize_Ori <- mobile_dataset$RamSize
mobile_dataset$RomSize_Ori <- mobile_dataset$RomSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% separate(RomSize, c("RomSize_num", "RomSize_Unit")) %>% mutate(RomSize_Unit= mapvalues(.$RomSize_Unit, from = c("GB", "MB", "KB"), to = c(1, 1/1000, 1/1000000)))
#step 6.3: remove any rows that are not numeric value for RomSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_num)),]
mobile_dataset$RomSize_num <- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_num)
mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit <- ifelse(is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit)), 0, as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit))
#Step 6.4: generate the final column RomSize_inGB
mobile_dataset$RomSize_inGB <- mobile_dataset$RomSize_num * mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit


#Step 7: Get the numeric part of RamSize (remove GB and MB, but convert MB to GB), discard any record that no numeric in RamSize
#Step 7.1: split RamSize into two columns with size number and unit, and convert MB to 1/1000GB
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% separate(RamSize, c("RamSize_num", "RamSize_Unit")) %>% mutate(RamSize_Unit= mapvalues(.$RamSize_Unit, from = c("GB", "MB"), to = c(1, 1/1000)))
#step 7.2: remove any rows that are not numeric value for RamSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_num)),]
mobile_dataset$RamSize_num<- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_num)
mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit <- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit)
#Step 7.3: generate the final column RamSize_inGB
mobile_dataset$RamSize_inGB <- mobile_dataset$RamSize_num * mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit


#Step 8: Create a new column to determine if the phone is 5G or not
mobile_dataset$Is_5G <- ifelse(str_detect(mobile_dataset$Model_Only, "5G"), "Yes", "No")
#Step 9: only keep the columns we need
column_names <- c("Model", "Company", "Price", "Rating", "No_of_ratings", "TotalReviwes", "Model_Only", "Color", "Price_Level", "RamSize_inGB", "RomSize_inGB", "RamSize_Ori", "RomSize_Ori", "Is_5G" )
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[column_names]

# #Step 9: final check up. Convert all company name to uppercase and then do a final duplicated removal
# mobile_dataset$Company <- toupper(mobile_dataset$Company)
# mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!duplicated(mobile_dataset),]
write.csv(mobile_dataset, file = './Cleaned_Mobile_Dataset.csv', row.names = F)
```



After cleaning and breaking down columns, the dataset now consists of 14 columns and 725 rows and no missing values. These 14 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Model_Only**: categorical variable: only contains the model information of a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **Color**: categorical variable: color of a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price_Level**: The price level of a mobile phone, with levels of "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High". - **Independent Variable**
* **RamSize_inGB**: continuous variable. RAM specification of the phone in GB. - **Independent Variable**
* **RomSize_inGB**: continuous variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone in GB. - **Independent Variable**
* **RamSize_Ori**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone, original information. - **Independent Variable**
* **RomSize_Ori**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone, original information. - **Independent Variable**
* **Is_5G**: categorical variable. If the phone has 5G service or not. - **Independent Variable**

#  Chapter 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
## 4.1: A summary of the dataset
The dimension of the cleaned dataset is 726 rows and 14 columns. A summary of the data is as follows:
```{r 4.1 Summary, results='hold'}
mobile_dataset <- as_tibble(read.csv("./Cleaned_Mobile_Dataset.csv"))
#Specify the level for Price_Level column
mobile_dataset$Price_Level <- factor(mobile_dataset$Price_Level, levels = c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"))
mobile_dataset %>% summary()
```
**Table 2**: A summary for Mobile Phone dataset

## 4.2: Exploratory Data Analysis
This section is focused on the exploration of relation between variables using various visualization techniques.

The main target is Price in the dataset. In the following visualization it shows the distribution of Mobile Phone price with long tail towards to the high end. The average price is 15902 Rupees. Most price falls in the range of 50000 Rupees. One really stands out price range (arrow indicated) is 1000-2000 Rupees with the highest frequency.
```{r 4.2.1, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset, mapping = aes(x=Price)) + geom_histogram(color="black", fill="white", bins = 100)+
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(Price)),
            color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=0.4) + geom_label(
    label="Mean Price = 15902", 
    x= mean(mobile_dataset$Price) + 10000,
    y=100,
    label.padding = unit(0.35, "lines"),
    label.size = 0.25,
    color = "black",
    fill="#69b3a2"
  ) +  geom_segment(aes(x = -5000, y = 140, xend = 0, yend = 130),lineend = "round",linejoin = "round",
                  arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))) + labs(y="Count", x="Price in Rupees", 
       subtitle="Distribution of Mobile Phone price") +
       geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 5000), color="red", linetype="dashed", size=0.4) +
       geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 22000), color="red", linetype="dashed", size=0.4)
```
The following figure is to break down the Price by different phone-making companies. There are a total of 37 companies in the dataset. Iin consistent with previous figure about Price distribution, we see a big portion of Price falls between 9000 (left dash line) and 40000 (right dash line) Rupees. _Apple_ alone contributes the most of high priced Mobile Phones, while companies like from _NOKIA_ to _GFIVE_ contribute to the low-priced ones.
```{r 4.2.2,fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset, mapping = aes(y = reorder(Company, Price), x = Price)) +geom_boxplot()+ geom_line() +
    sapply(c(9000, 40000), function(xint) geom_vline(aes(xintercept = xint), color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=0.4)) + labs(y="Company", x="Price in Rupees", 
       subtitle="Boxplot for Mobile Phone price from different companies")
```
The Price is further broken down by their 5G services. Interestingly, neither high-priced nor low-priced Mobile Phones have equipped 5G service. In contrast, almost all middle-priced Mobile Phones have 5G service. Price for those with 5G service are slightly more expensive than those without. NOTE: the dashed line indicates the price between 9000 (left dash line) and 40000 (right dash line) Rupees.

```{r 4.2.3, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset, mapping = aes(y = reorder(Company, Price), x = Price, color = Is_5G)) +geom_boxplot(position=position_dodge(width = 0.8))+ geom_line() +
    sapply(c(9000, 40000), function(xint) geom_vline(aes(xintercept = xint), color="blue", linetype="dashed", size=0.4)) + labs(y="Company", x="Price in Rupees", 
       subtitle="Boxplot for Mobile Phone price from different companies with 5G service (No / Yes)") + facet_wrap(~Is_5G)
```
The pattern is more obvious when we provide color for 4 different price level ("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High"). Although mobile phones from companies like APPLE, GOOGLE, ASUS and NOTHING have no 5G service, their price are all very high. It is worth investigating if some other attributes like brand effect, Storage capacity (Rom Size), and calculation power (Ram Size) are playing roles. Most Mobile Phones (except MI) with 5G service, again, have a higher proportion falling in a Very High price level, compared to the counterparts without 5G service. Almost all the rest mobile phones without 5G service fall in a Low price level.

```{r 4.2.4, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(y =reorder(Company, Price), fill = Price_Level)) + geom_bar(stat = "count", position="fill") + labs(y="Company", x="Percentage", 
       subtitle="Percent Boxplot for Mobile Phone price from different companies with 5G service (No / Yes)") + facet_wrap(~Is_5G)
```

Next, we explored some quantitative features with respect to the Mobile Phone price. The first scatter plot shows an obvious positive relation between Rating and Price as the smooth line indicates. The higher the Rating, the higher the Price. And this holds when we remove those bottom left 2 outlier data points. 
```{r 4.2.5, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
#The first plot is one with outlier
plot1 = ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(x = Rating, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(se=T) + 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 2.6, y = 20000, xend = 2.67, yend = 10000),lineend = "round",linejoin = "round",arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))) +   
  geom_point(data=mobile_dataset[mobile_dataset$Rating<3.0,], aes(x = Rating, y = Price), color='red') +
  labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Rating", subtitle="Relation between rating and price")

#The first plot is a one with outliers removed
plot2 = ggplot(data = mobile_dataset[mobile_dataset$Rating>3.0, ],mapping = aes(x = Rating, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(se=T) +
  labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Rating", subtitle="Relation between rating and price after removing \nbottom left 2 outliers")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```

The second scatter plot shows the relation between Total number of rating and Price. As the smooth line indicates, there is no obvious correlation between them. The result holds even when we remove some seemingly outliers on the far right end.
```{r 4.2.6, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(x = No_of_ratings, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth()+ labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Total number of rating", subtitle="Relation between total nubmer of rating and price")
```
The same pattern is also observed in the third scatter plot where relation between Total number of reviews and Price is plotted. As the smooth line indicates, there is no obvious correlation between them. The result holds even when we remove some seemingly outliers on the far right end.
```{r 4.2.7, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(x = TotalReviwes, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth()+ labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Total number of reviews", subtitle="Relation between total nubmer of reviews and price")
```
In the fourth scatter plot, below, there seems a slight positive relation between Ram size (in GB) and the Price. Ram is normally associated with speed and performance of an operating system. The higher ram is, the better it is in speed and performance. It makes sense that a mobile phone with a larger Ram will charge more. However, because nowadays most mobile phones are very fast and stable, people wont tell too much difference, making the added on value from ram is only weekly associated with price.
```{r 4.2.8, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(x = RamSize_inGB, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(se=T)+ labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Ram Size in GB", subtitle="Relation between Ram size (in GB) and price")
```
In the final scatter plot, again, we have two charts, one the original dataset, the other with outlier removed. Both cases tells the same story. In contrast to the previous scatter plot (Ram size (in GB) and the Price), there is a very obvious positive linear relation between Rom size (in GB) and the Price. This makes sense because often times a mobile phone is more limited by its non-volatile memory space than its speed & performance.
```{r 4.2.9, fig.height=4, fig.width=10, results='hold'}
#The first plot is a one with outliers
plot1 = ggplot(data = mobile_dataset,mapping = aes(x = RomSize_inGB, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(se=T, method = lm)+ 
  geom_segment(aes(x = 490, y = 100000, xend = 500, yend = 90000),lineend = "round",linejoin = "round",arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.5, "cm"))) +   
  geom_point(data=mobile_dataset[mobile_dataset$RomSize_inGB>400,], aes(x = RomSize_inGB, y = Price), color='red') +
  labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Rom Size in GB", subtitle="Relation between Rom size (in GB) and price")

#The second plot is a one with outliers removed
plot2 = ggplot(data = mobile_dataset[mobile_dataset$RomSize_inGB<400, ],mapping = aes(x = RomSize_inGB, y = Price)) + geom_point(alpha=0.3) + geom_smooth(se=T,method = lm) +
  labs(y="Price in Rupees", x="Rom Size in GB", subtitle="Relation between Rom size (in GB) and price")

grid.arrange(plot1, plot2, ncol=2)
```
