# Introduction

Mobile phones are everywhere, so are the prices. Despite still having the word "phone" in the name, a typical modern smartphone has much more features than just to make and receive calls. They are boasting a staggering range of applications like brand, memory, storage, camera, resolution, just to name a few. All these cutting edge technology and features packed in one little device does not come without a cost. A [2020 review](https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/bills/article-8548235/High-end-mobile-phones-price-soared-490-20-years.html) of premium mobile phones shows a staggering _490%_ rise in the last two decades.

With so many mobile phones on the market, it can be difficult to decide which one you want to buy. As a customer, we are particularly interested in finding some relation between all these features and its selling price. To this purpose, we collected the [MobilePhone's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudhanshuy17/mobilephone) from Kaggle and apply a set of statistical analysis hoping to answer some guiding questions:

1. Can we estimate the average price for mobile phones?
2. What is the impact of each mobile phone's feature on the selling price?
3. Can a classification model to distinguish the selling price range?
3. Can we build a decent model to predict the selling price for a mobile phone?


# Dataset and Cleanup

The initial dataset consists of 8 columns and 28,036 rows and no missing values. These 8 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **RAM size**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **ROM size**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone. - **Independent Variable**

Some initial steps can be completed to clean the dataset and create new variables which can be used in our analysis. The initial steps for cleaning the dataset are as follows:

1. Remove any duplicates in the dataset;
2. Because **Model** column contains sub-class of a mobile phone, we decide to further break it down to _Model_ and _Color_;
3. Convert all units from **RAM size** and **ROM size** measure to GB and then remove unit suffix;
4. Add additional column to segment the **Price** into 4 different levels;
5. Add additional column to determine if a phone has %G feature or not based on **Model** information.

```{r Cleanup}
mobile_dataset <- read.csv("./Updated_Mobile_Dataset.csv")
#Break down Model column into Model only and Color columns
#Step 1: remove the Company name from Model
Model_no_Company <- stringr::str_remove(mobile_dataset$Model,mobile_dataset$Company) %>% trimws(., which = c("both"))
#Step 2: remove anything after parentheses to get Model only info
mobile_dataset$Model_Only <- stringr::str_replace(Model_no_Company, " \\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)", "")
#Step 3: Get the color information from inside the last ()
#Step 3.1: Get the parenthesis and what is inside from the last ()
Model_no_Company_parenthesis <- stringr::str_extract(Model_no_Company, "(?<=\\()([^()]*?)(?=\\)[^()]*$)")
#step 3.2: Get the color by just retaining the info before ,
mobile_dataset$Color <- gsub(",.*$", "", Model_no_Company_parenthesis)
#Step 4: Remove duplicated rows in the dataset
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!duplicated(mobile_dataset),]
#Step 5: cut the price based on the percentile into 4 different levels
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% mutate(Price_Level = ntile(Price, n = 4))
#Step 5.1: map each number level to the character
from <- c(1,2,3,4)
to <- c("Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High")
mobile_dataset$Price_Level <- mapvalues(mobile_dataset$Price_Level, from = from, to = to)


#Step 6: Get the numeric part of RomSize (remove GB and MB, but convert MB to GB), discard any record that no numeric in RomSize
#Step 6.1: there are some data input errors for RamSize and RomSize. In the records where RomSize is "Not Known" are swapped with RamSize, so we need to correct that.
RamSize_temp <- ifelse(mobile_dataset$RomSize == "Not Known", "0 GB", mobile_dataset$RamSize)
mobile_dataset$RomSize <- ifelse(mobile_dataset$RomSize == "Not Known", mobile_dataset$RamSize, mobile_dataset$RomSize)
mobile_dataset$RamSize <- RamSize_temp
#Step 6.2: split RomSize into two columns with size number and unit, and convert MB to 1/1000GB, KB to 1/1000000GB
mobile_dataset$RamSize_Ori <- mobile_dataset$RamSize
mobile_dataset$RomSize_Ori <- mobile_dataset$RomSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% separate(RomSize, c("RomSize_num", "RomSize_Unit")) %>% mutate(RomSize_Unit= mapvalues(.$RomSize_Unit, from = c("GB", "MB", "KB"), to = c(1, 1/1000, 1/1000000)))
#step 6.3: remove any rows that are not numeric value for RomSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_num)),]
mobile_dataset$RomSize_num <- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_num)
mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit <- ifelse(is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit)), 0, as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit))
#Step 6.4: generate the final column RomSize_inGB
mobile_dataset$RomSize_inGB <- mobile_dataset$RomSize_num * mobile_dataset$RomSize_Unit


#Step 7: Get the numeric part of RamSize (remove GB and MB, but convert MB to GB), discard any record that no numeric in RamSize
#Step 7.1: split RamSize into two columns with size number and unit, and convert MB to 1/1000GB
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset %>% separate(RamSize, c("RamSize_num", "RamSize_Unit")) %>% mutate(RamSize_Unit= mapvalues(.$RamSize_Unit, from = c("GB", "MB"), to = c(1, 1/1000)))
#step 7.2: remove any rows that are not numeric value for RamSize
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!is.na(as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_num)),]
mobile_dataset$RamSize_num<- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_num)
mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit <- as.numeric(mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit)
#Step 7.3: generate the final column RamSize_inGB
mobile_dataset$RamSize_inGB <- mobile_dataset$RamSize_num * mobile_dataset$RamSize_Unit


#Step 8: Create a new column to determine if the phone is 5G or not
mobile_dataset$Is_5G <- ifelse(str_detect(mobile_dataset$Model_Only, "5G"), "Yes", "No")
#Step 9: only keep the columns we need
column_names <- c("Model", "Company", "Price", "Rating", "No_of_ratings", "TotalReviwes", "Model_Only", "Color", "Price_Level", "RamSize_inGB", "RomSize_inGB", "RamSize_Ori", "RomSize_Ori", "Is_5G" )
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[column_names]

#Step 9: final check up. Convert all company name to uppercase and then do a final duplicated removal
mobile_dataset$Company <- toupper(mobile_dataset$Company)
mobile_dataset <- mobile_dataset[!duplicated(mobile_dataset),]
write.csv(mobile_dataset, file = './Cleaned_Mobile_Dataset.csv', row.names = F)
```



After cleaning and breaking down columns, the dataset now consists of 14 columns and 726 rows and no missing values. These 14 columns are:

* **Model**: categorical variables with sub-classes. These names include the color of the unit
and its storage capacity. The latter being also listed as a separate column. - **Independent Variable**
* **Company**: categorical variable. Name of the phone's manufacturer. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Dependent Variable**
* **Rating**: continuous variable. Units in Indian Rupees. - **Independent Variable**
* **Number of ratings**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Total reviews**: discrete variable: a simple count. - **Independent Variable**
* **Model_Only**: categorical variable: only contains the model information of a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **Color**: categorical variable: color of a mobile phone. - **Independent Variable**
* **Price_Level**: The price level of a mobile phone, with levels of "Low", "Medium", "High", "Very High". - **Independent Variable**
* **RamSize_inGB**: continuous variable. RAM specification of the phone in GB. - **Independent Variable**
* **RomSize_inGB**: continuous variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone in GB. - **Independent Variable**
* **RamSize_Ori**: categorical variable. RAM specification of the phone, original information. - **Independent Variable**
* **RomSize_Ori**: categorical variable. Storage (non-volatile memory) capacity of the phone, original information. - **Independent Variable**
* **Is_5G**: categorical variable. If the phone has 5G service or not. - **Independent Variable**
